This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Here's what I wrote as the description on the site:

Often I'll ask myself what I should be doing, or what I want to be doing, or why I'm doing something. And these are tough questions. I don't think I can answer them authoritatively (and I don't think I'd want to). But I do want something I can consider when I'm trying to answer these questions. The following are a list of values that I've reflected on and consider important to me and the type of work I want to be doing.
            
This isn't meant to be a complete list of everything that I find valuable, it's just what I came up with when I was thinking about it. Maybe if you ask me now (at the time you're reading this), my answer would be different, but for this moment (the one where I'm writing this), these are some ideas that I resonate with very strongly.
